         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E cannot but extreamly wonder, that the causlesse jealousies concerning Us, raised and fomented by a malignant Party in this Kingdom, which desires nothing more then to snatch themselves particular advantages out of a generall combustion (which means of advantage shall never be ministred to them by Our fault or seeking) should not onely be able to seduce a weak party in this Our Kingdom, but seem to find so much countenance even from both Houses, as that Our raising of a Guard (without further designe, then for the safety of Our Person; an action so legall in manner, so peaceable upon causes so evident and necessarie) should not onely be looked upon, and petitioned against by them, as a causlesse jealousie, but declared to be the raising of a war against them, contrary to Our forme Professions of Our care of Religion and Law. And we no lesse wonder, that this Action of Ours should be said (in a very large expression) to be apprehended by the Inhabitants of this Countrey, as an affrightment and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to Our People; having been as well received here, as it is every where to be justified; and (We speak now of the generall, not of a few seduced particulars) as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>sted and sped by this Countrey, with that loyall affection and alacrity, as is a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example set to the rest of the Kingdom, of care of Our safety upon all occasions, and shall never be forgotten by Us, nor we hope, by Our Posterity; but shall be ever payed to them in that which is the proper expression of a Princes gratitude, A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vigilant care to govern them justly, and to preserve the onely Rule by which they can be governed, The Law of the Land. And we are confident, That if you were your selves Eye-witnesses, you would see so the contrary, as to give little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thanks, and hereafter little credit to your Informers: And if you have no better intelligence of the inclinations and affections of the rest of the Kingdom, certainly the minds of Our People (which to some ends and purposes you represent) are but ill represented unto you.</p>
            <p>Have you so many moneths together not contented your selves to rely for securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as your Predecessors have done) upon the affection of the people, but by your own single authority raised to your selves a Guard, (and that sometimes of no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary numbers, and in no ordinary way) And could not all those Pikes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, that Army on one side, and that Navie on the other, perswade Us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to disband your Forces, and to content your selves with your ordinarie

This is Our case, notwithstanding the care and fidelity of Our Parliament, Our Fort is kept by armed men against Us, Our proper goods, first detained from Us, and then, contrary to Our Command, by strong hand, offered to be carried away (in which at once all Our property, as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Person, all Our Authority as a King, are wrested from Us;) and yet for Us to secure Our selves in a legall way (that Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> may not by the same Forces, or by more raised, by pretence of the same Authority (for they say he raiseth daily some, and know it no new thing for him to pretend Orders that he cannot shew) continue the war that he hath leavied against Us, and as well imprison Our Person, as detain Our Goods, and as well shut Us up in <hi>York,</hi> as shut Us out of <hi>Hull.</hi>) is said to be esteemed a cause of great jealousie to the Parliament, a raising War against them, and of danger to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
